# Model1 test data files

This directory contains the test data for the model1 test. The test data is generated by running the
following command:

```bash
python3 model1.py
cargo run model1.onnx ./
```

The following files are generated:

- `model1.onnx`: The ONNX model
- `model1.rs`: The generated Rust code for the model (the path in the comment needs to be fixed for
  the test)
- `model1.json`: The data of the model
- `model1.graph.txt`: The IR of the model
