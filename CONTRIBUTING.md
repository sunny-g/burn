# Contributing to the Burn Project

Welcome to the Burn project! We're thrilled that you're considering contributing to our project.
Every contribution helps, and we're delighted to have you on board.

## How to Contribute?

Here are some steps to guide you through the process of contributing to the Burn project:

### Step 1: Review the Issue Tickets

Before you start working on a contribution, please take a moment to look through the open issues in
the [issue tracker](https://github.com/burn-rs/burn/issues) for this project. This will give you an
idea of what kind of work is currently being planned or is in progress.

### Step 2: Get Familiar with the Project Architecture

It's crucial to have an understanding of the [project's architecture](/ARCHITECTURE.md). Familiarize
yourself with the structure of the project, the purpose of different components, and how they
interact with each other. This will give you the context needed to make meaningful contributions.

### Step 3: Fork and Clone the Repository

Before you can start making changes, you'll need to fork the Burn repository and clone it to your
local machine. This can be done via the GitHub website or the GitHub Desktop application. Here are
the steps:

1. Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page to create a copy of this project in your
   GitHub account.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by clicking the "Code" button on the
   GitHub website and copying the URL. Then open a terminal on your local machine and type
   `git clone [the URL you copied]`.

### Step 4: Create a New Branch

It's a good practice to create a new branch for each contribution you make. This keeps your changes
organized and separated from the main project, which can make the process of reviewing and merging
your changes easier. You can create a new branch by using the command
`git checkout -b [branch-name]`.

### Step 5: Make Your Changes

Once you have set up your local repository and created a new branch, you can start making changes.
Be sure to follow the coding standards and guidelines used in the rest of the project.

### Step 6: Run the Pre-Pull Request Script

Before you open a pull request, please run the [`run-checks.sh`](/run-before-pr.sh) script. This
will ensure that your changes are in line with our project's standards and guidelines. You can run
this script by opening a terminal, navigating to your local project directory, and typing
`./run-checks`.

### Step 7: Submit a Pull Request

After you've made your changes and run the pre-pull request script, you're ready to submit a pull
request. This can be done through the GitHub website or the
[GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/).

When submitting your pull request, please provide a brief description of the changes you've made and
the issue or issues that your changes address.
